I am a mad fan of it .In today's generation mobile phone and other electronic devices were destroying many aspects of Childhood . But Harry Potter books made them back to reading . The book also shows that real friends are not less than our own brothers and sister. I think J.K. Rowling is an unforgettable contemporary icon .",
